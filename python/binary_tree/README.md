# Trees

A Binare tree is where every node has a maximum o 2 nodes. every node to the left is lower and every node to the right is higher

## Challenge

New Implementation of Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

## Approach & Efficiency

Used regression to traverse through tree in each different way. Also implemented add ans search methods


## Code Callenge 16 Challenge Summary

write a method to find the maximum value in a binary tree

### Challenge 16 Approach & Efficiency

used a while loop to traverse to the rightmost node in the tree, and return that value
