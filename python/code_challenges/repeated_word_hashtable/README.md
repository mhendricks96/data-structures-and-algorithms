# Code Challenge 30: Hashtable Repeated Word

Find the first repeated word in a book.

## Challenge

Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string

## Approach & Efficiency

I wrote a function that splices a string and puts every word into a different index. Once it reaches a word that alreay exists in the hashtable, it returns that word.
