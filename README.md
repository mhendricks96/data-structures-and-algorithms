## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository, at the top level is a folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Whiteboard Process
