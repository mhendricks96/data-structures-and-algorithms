# Challenge Summary

write a function that takes in 2 linked lists and returns 1 linked list with the values zippered.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used 2 pinters to hold the values. Each time the pointers move, i am sliping in the value from list 2 in between the current node in list 1 and the next node in list 1
