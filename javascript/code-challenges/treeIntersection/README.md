# Code Challenge 32: Common Values

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure

## Challenge

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.

## Approach & Efficiency

I created a function that uses breadth first traversals on each of the trees to get the values and then compares them to return a list that contains all of the common values.
