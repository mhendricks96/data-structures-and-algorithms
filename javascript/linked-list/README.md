# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a set of connected nodes. each node has a value and knows what the next node is.

## Challenge

Implement a singly linked list with a node class and a linkedlist class. the linkes list class should have the following methods: insert, includes, and to_string.

## API

### insert()

Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

## includes()

Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

## to_string()

Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
